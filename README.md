## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start 

Just clone this repo and open it in Unity Editor! Simple as that.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dynamic Volume Simulation:** Renders 3D scenes by simulating voxel visibility as the LED matrix rotates.
* **Custom Shader Algorithms:** Uses custom shaders to calculate transparency and shading based on the intersection of the rotating display plane with 3D objects.

## üìù Edit Me!
